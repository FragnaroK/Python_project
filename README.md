# Python_project
First project using python and "eel" library.

It should be a "project manager" with shortcuts like "open terminal in this project and VScode", "Mount local (DEV) server of this project". And the goal is detect the framework and give options related to the framework.

I'm doing this just because I have free time, motivation to learn python and because manage my projects with bash/batch scripts is not enough.

*** EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT ***
